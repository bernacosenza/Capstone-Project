    "Through this article we will analyze the neighborhoods of toronto and identify the best area, theoretically, to open a restaurant. The purpose of this analysis is to serve as a basis to introduce and attract potential investors from the food industry and / or local families looking for a new investment, thus stimulating the city's economy. The location in which a business is established is fundamental to its success, especially when it comes to restaurants, so it is important to study the various possible locations in order to reduce the risks of the investment failing."

    "To carry out this study we will mainly use FourSquare, a technology company that built a massive dataset of location data. We will also use a table containing the postal codes of canada, imported from wikipegia, as well as a csv file with its coordinates. These will be the necessary tools to explore and analyze the different neighborhoods of toronto to identify different parameters, such as: number of restaurants, ratings, proximity to businesses, among others."
